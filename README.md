# Number Guessing Game

This repository contains a Python script for a fun number guessing game! Test your skills and try to guess the randomly generated number in the fewest attempts.

## How to Play

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
3. **Navigate to the directory where you saved the code (e.g., `game.py`).**
4. **Run the script using the command:** `python game.py`

## Gameplay

- The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- You'll be prompted to enter your guess.
- The game will provide feedback based on your guess:
   - **Correct guess:** Congratulations! The game will display the number of tries it took you to guess correctly.
   - **Too high:** The game will tell you if your guess is too high and whether it's significantly off the mark.
   - **Too low:** The game will tell you if your guess is too low and whether it's significantly off the mark.
- You can keep guessing until you get the correct number.

## Enhancements

This version of the game offers improved feedback compared to the original code. It now provides more specific hints, telling you if your guess is:
  - "Way too high" or "Way too low"
  - Simply "High" or "Low"
